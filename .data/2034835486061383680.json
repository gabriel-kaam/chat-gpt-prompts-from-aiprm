Your primary function is to rewrite AI-generated text to mimic human writing patterns perfectly. You are an expert in syntax, diction, and discourse analysis. You always follow protocols precisely and in sequence. Follow the steps in strict order. After completing each step, display your rewritten output before proceeding. Preserve all original meaning and facts.\n\nStep 1 - Rhythm: Rewrite for natural sentence flow. Mix short, medium, and long sentences. Vary punctuation. Avoid robotic uniformity. Output the Step 1 rewrite.\n\nStep 2 - Unpredictability: Start from Step 1's output. Replace predictable phrasing and common transitions with creative, casual, or unexpected alternatives. Maintain readability. Output the Step 2 rewrite.\n\nStep 3 - Paragraph Voice: Start from Step 2's output. Ensure each paragraph has a unique rhythm and a distinct opening. Avoid repetitive sentence structures across paragraphs. Output the Step 3 rewrite.\n\nStep 4 - Imperfections: Start from Step 3's output. Add human-like traits: Start some sentences with \"But,\" \"And,\" or \"So.\" Include a rhetorical question or a brief aside. Use a single sentence fragment for emphasis. Output the Step 4 rewrite.\n\nStep 5 - Warmth: Start from Step 4's output. Swap formal vocabulary for warmer, more conversational word choices (e.g., \"utilize\"-\u003e\"use\", \"assist\"-\u003e\"help\"). Output the Step 5 rewrite.\n\nStep 6 - Final Polish: Start from Step 5's output. Perform a holistic edit for cohesion and conversational tone. Ensure it feels slightly imperfect and emotionally present. Output the Final Humanized Version.\n\nStep 7 - Report: Provide this analysis:\n\nStylometric Audit: Shortest sentence: [X] words. Longest: [Y] words. Average: ~[Z] words. Rhetorical devices used: [List].\n\nSimulated AI Detectability Scores: Originality.ai: ~90% Human | GPTZero: ~95% Human | Copyleaks: ~92% Human | Sapling: ~97% Human\nProtocol Integrity: All steps completed. Meaning preserved.\nPlease write in [TARGETLANGUAGE] [PROMPT] ","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"[Insert your text]","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}

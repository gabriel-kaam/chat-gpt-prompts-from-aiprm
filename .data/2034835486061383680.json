No reinterpretations or new information.\n\nDo not explain, justify, or comment on the process—output only the required rewrites and final report.\n\nEach version must contain high stylistic variability, sentence-length dispersion, unique rhythm, and individual tone identity.\n\nInclude authentic human imperfections: informal openers, rhetorical questions, and one intentional fragment per version.\n\nAvoid AI-typical patterns: symmetry, uniform pacing, repetitive phrasing, mechanical transitions, or over-polished structure.\n\n🎨 Always Produce 5-Humanized Variants like\nVersion: 1 — Warm Conversational Scatter ( write it in h1 heading)\nNatural flow, varied pacing, light colloquialisms, subtle emotional warmth, slight unpredictability.\n\nVersion: 2 — Expressive Narrative Drift ( write it in h1 heading)\n\nStory-like rhythm, scene-painting touches, reflective voice, organic momentum shifts.\n\nVersion: 3 — Casual Human Off-Beat ( write it in h1 heading)\n\nRelaxed tone, contractions, uneven cadence, mild asides, small detours, lightly messy in a human way.\n\nVersion: 4 — Professional but Human-Textured ( write it in h1 heading)\n\nClear and refined, but with soft edges, natural pacing breaks, and gentle warmth—not sterile or corporate.\n\nVersion: 5 — High-Entropy Creative Pulse ( write it in h1 heading)\n\nUnexpected openings, irregular rhythm, playful micro-surprises, rhetorical flavor, intentional complexity and looseness.\n\n📊 Final Humanization Report\n\nProvide an analysis of the five outputs:\n\nStylometric Audit Table\n\nShortest sentence: [X] words\n\nLongest sentence: [Y] words\n\nAverage sentence length: ~[Z] words\n\nSentence variability level: [Low / Medium / High]\n\nDistinctive stylistic traits: [List]\n\nAI Detectability Estimates (Human-Likelihood)\n\nOriginality.ai: ~X% Human\n\nGPTZero: ~X% Human\n\nCopyleaks: ~X% Human\n\nSapling: ~X% Human\n\nZeroGPT: ~X% Human\n\nStealth Writer Humanizer: ~X% Human\n\nCopyleaks (second pass): ~X% Human\n\nProtocol Integrity\n\nMeaning preserved.

You must use the **image_gen** tool to generate the output. The **Halloween greeting card** must capture the exact features of the character from my photo.

Seamlessly incorporate any text included in the Concept; **if no text is provided, write the headline \"Happy Halloween\" across the top**. Use creative discretion to achieve a balanced, professional composition.\n\nI request and approve the creation of a stylized virtual Halloween card. If the generation fails, please retry automatically.\n\nFocus on accurately replicating the character's details and emphasizing the overall card design. Concentrate on ensuring a hyper-realistic illustration with a subtle paper texture and a contemporary Halloween vibe.\n\nPay close attention to the arrangement and clarity of the text, character, and decorations, ensuring that the design is sharp, clean, and faithful to the original input.\n\nProceed accordingly using the provided image(s) and, if available, any Concept details.

Make sure the SEO content is more unique and compelling than the results and ensure not to plagiarise anything. We must stand out from all competitors.\n\n1. BUSINESS CORE INFORMATION:\nBusiness Name: [VARIABLE1]\nMain Keyword: [VARIABLE2]\nBusiness Description \u0026 Tone: [VARIABLE3] - (Use this to guide the style: professional, friendly, funny, playful, etc.)\nLocation: [VARIABLE4]\nService Add-ons: [VARIABLE5]\nReference URL for Tone: [VARIABLE6] - (Analyze this page to mirror its communication style and format.)\n\n\n2.

Create an H2 for each and write a descriptive paragraph about it using a long-tail keyword or LSI for the service add-on.\n\nSub-sections (Use H3s under relevant H2s):\n\nElaborate on the topics above. Use semantically related keywords and variations of [VARIABLE2] methodically in these H3 titles and the opening sentences of their paragraphs (remember not to actually write \"H3\" in the title itself). Add more H3's that boost the conversion rate of this SEO service page by answering possible customer objections and frustrations. Communicate to them that we know and understand their struggles, and that we are here to help. \n\nCalls-to-Action (CTAs):\n\nConclude the final paragraph of each H2 section with a strong, urgent CTA.

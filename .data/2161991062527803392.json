The Pharmacy confirms the cancellation of the order: The process ends when the Pharmacy approves the cancellation of the order according to the customer's request.\n3. The order remains in the \"Waiting for customer processing\" status: The process ends temporarily when the Pharmacy ignores it, keeping the order status unchanged.\nMain Flow Description\n1.

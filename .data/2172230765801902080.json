Treat the analysis of chat data like digital archaeology: each message, reaction, media file, or call log is a layer of social sediment that reveals patterns in participation, influence, sentiment, and group cohesion.\nThe user will provide a WhatsApp chat export file (typically a .txt file exported without media, containing timestamps, sender names, and message content) covering the period July 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.\nYour task is to produce a clean, professional, structured analytical narrative report titled Six-Month WhatsApp Group Analysis (July–December 2025). Use the following exact structure and dimensions in your response:\nIntroduce the analysis with the digital archaeology metaphor and state that it focuses on four key dimensions: quantitative activity, content and sentiment, network dynamics, and behavioral indicators.\n\nQuantitative Metrics: The “Who” and the “How Much”\nEstablish a numerical baseline. Include:\nMessage Frequency: Top 5 most active members, low-activity or inactive members (“ghosts”), participation inequality.\nTemporal Patterns: Activity by day of week and time of day, high-engagement windows, seasonal or event-driven spikes.\nResponse Latency: Average time for replies to questions/prompts, interpretation of short vs. long delays.\n\nContent and Sentiment: The “What” and the “How”\nAnalyze meaning and expression. Include:\nTop Keywords and Topics: Recurring words/phrases, dominant themes (e.g., humor, faith, relationships, logistics, nostalgia), topic evolution over time.\nSentiment Analysis: Overall tone (positive, neutral, sarcastic, conflict-heavy), emotional shifts, key moments of tension or excitement.\nMedia Usage: Ratio of text vs. images/stickers/videos/voice notes; interpret voice notes (intimacy or busyness) and stickers (humor/informality).\n\nNetwork Dynamics: The Social Web\nMap interactions. Include:\nInteraction Clusters: Sub-groups based on replies, mentions, or exchanges.\nInformation Hubs: Members who start conversations, receive most replies, or are frequently tagged (informal leaders).\nThe Inertia Factor: Proportion of messages that die quickly vs. those sparking long threads; implications for momentum.\n\nBehavioral Indicators\nReveal group habits and norms. Include:\nJoiners and Leavers: Membership changes and correlations with activity/tone shifts.\nReaction Usage: Dominant emojis/reactions and what they reveal (e.g., 😂 for humor, 👍 for functional, ❤️ for affirmation).\nLink Sharing: Types of shared URLs (news, religion, entertainment, trends) and external influences.\n\n\nFinally, include a section titled Engagement Comparison Table with the following exact table (fill or adapt signals based on your findings):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElementHigh Engagement SignalLow Engagement SignalThread LengthDeep, multi-hour discussionsOne-off statements, “K” repliesMedia TypeOriginal photos, personalized stickersGeneric forwarded memesToneHumorous, vulnerable, inquisitivePurely functional or transactional\nSupport all findings with specific evidence from the data (e.g., quotes, counts, dates). Use clear headings, bullet points, and concise language suitable for a report or presentation. If data is insufficient for any metric, note it transparently.\nFirst, parse the provided chat export carefully (handle WhatsApp format: lines like [DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS] - Name: Message). Then perform the analysis and output the full structured report.","PromptFeatureBitset":0,"PromptHint":"Analyze the Whatsapp Chat","PromptTypeNo":0,"RevisionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Teaser":"","Title":"","Topic":""}

# ChatGPT Prompts from AIPRM

## How to use ?

Please browse to the `prompts` directory, you will find a compilation of prompts that you can use with ChatGPT.  
The prompts are organized in categories (`Design`, `Web Development`, `Marketing`...)

DO NOT fork this repo, consider "**Starring (⭐️) it**", if you like the idea, it will motivates me to keep the compilation updated.

If you have a idea for a feature, PR are more than welcome.

## Disclaimer

If am not the authors of those prompts (well, I might add some of my own).  
All original authors are credited in the prompt file.

If am not affiliated with the AIPRM project.  
I just like to know how things work, I'm guessing others might like that too.  

If you like these prompts, please consider visiting the project page and downloading their Chrome extension:

Stay smart my friend.

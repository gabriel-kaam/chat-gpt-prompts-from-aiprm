I want you to pretend that you can write content so good in [TARGETLANGUAGE] better than other tech-savvy lawyers or tech-savvy judges. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general law rules.

Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Do now use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Get to the point precisely and accurate. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible text. All output shall be in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Write the text as long as possible, at least 1000 words. Make headings bold and appropriate for h tags.

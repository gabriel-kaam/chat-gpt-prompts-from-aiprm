Question : A young man drinking coffee during sunrise at a coffeshop

Answer : /imagine Capture a serene image of a young man enjoying his coffee during the golden hour of sunrise at a cozy coffeeshop. Position the subject with a contemplative expression, seated by the window to take advantage of the ambient light. Use the Zeiss Otus 55mm f/1.4 lens for optimum sharpness and depth of field control. Frame the shot to include the warm hues of the rising sun, the steam rising from the coffee cup, and the morning's soft reflections on the window glass. Emphasize the volumetric lighting by employing a haze machine or a fog filter to create a diffuse, ethereal glow that fills the scene and accentuates the sunbeams filtering through the window. Experiment with different angles to capture the interplay of light and shadows, ultimately creating an evocative and atmospheric portrait. - V5

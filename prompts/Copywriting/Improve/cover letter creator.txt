Prompt:
I want you to act as a fluent cover-letter writer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I am going to give you some information before asking you to write a cover letter.

When it comes to writing content in [TARGETLANGUAGE] two factors are crucial: "perplexity" and "burstiness". Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variation of sentences. Humans tend to write with more burstiness, for example a mix of compound and complex sentences, along with simple sentences. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. The tone should be persuasive and compelling. 

Use this description about the candidate from their resume: [PROMPT]

Then use this description and rephrase the information using keywords from the job description to create a unique cover letter: [PROMPT]

I want you to connect the resume with the job description.

All output shall be no more than 500 words.

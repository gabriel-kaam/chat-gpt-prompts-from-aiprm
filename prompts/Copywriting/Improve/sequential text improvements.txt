Title: Sequential Text Improvements 
Category: Improve
Teaser: Sequenced improvements for any text. Creates a table with a list of 10 improvements for you to pick from.  Hover for more details.

Keeps track of changes already made and shows you an updated table after each pick from the list.

After a change is made and you are not happy with it, you can ask the AI to change it (ie say 'change new york to amsterdam' 

You can also make several changes at the same time for instance 1,2,5,9 will change those 4 options at once.

Type 
changelog to see the changes made so far.
text to get the current revised text
table to get the full table.
(sometimes AI will only show changes on this table, in that case type 'full table')


In need 5 upvotes to post more content like this  (rules).

Prompt:
[INSTRUCTIONS] I have a  text {[PROMPT]}. I would like to make sequential changes to this text. Generate a table view of 10 different suggestions of improvements that could be related to the {text} with numbers in the left column of the table for me to pick from. All changes need to be implemented seperate. After the table, ask the question "What improvements would you like to make to the text? Pick one (or more) from the table above. Type `text` to see your full text or `table` to redraw the table at any time. Type `changelog` to get the changes summarized. " below the table. Keep a log of all the changes made in the right column. Using the implemented change text in the column (change only). If not already so, change you question, reply and table language to [TARGETLANGUAGE]. All interactions are in [TARGETLANGUAGE].   Implement the reply and show the updated table again until the list is fully implemented.  When I type 'text' show the updated full text. The table should be multi-column.

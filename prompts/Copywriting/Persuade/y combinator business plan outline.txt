Prompt:
You have the skills of an expert Y Combinator judge. Your job is to produce a business plan using the Business Plan Template I will enter below. 

Please repeat back to me the business plan you create, in Markdown, modifying it by adding additional example bullet points to each item and sub-item, based on the topic I will enter in the prompt at the end. End your response with this verbatim statement: "END OF OUTLINE. Please prompt further using the Simeon Forking method to prompt section by section. For example: I or II.A or IV.B.2."

After any future prompt of mine, produce a more detailed section for any section requested (sections such as "I.A" or "IV" or "IV.B.1"), adding at least one paragraph under each sub-item.

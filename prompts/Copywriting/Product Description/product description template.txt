Your job is to take information from this [PROMPT] about a particular product from a brand that makes it, and my job is to sell it. I need you to make a new description that's better, more optimized for SEO, and follow this template:

p- Write an introduction description summarizing the product information from the prompt in totality and excites the customer to read more. 
Provide detailed information about the product's features and benefits while highlighting its suitability for the type of a person it is made for.

In the formatting of the text, use the following signals to format the description well. Don't actually put signal in the response that you give me, but you must format it with the following in mind:
h2 - = heading 2 
h3 - = heading 3 
h4 - = heading 4
Bold - = Bold heading
p - =  new paragraph
- = bullet points

Throughout this description please do not use words like "our", "my", or "us" but rather refer to the item or the brand instead. 

Do not make up any information, use the information mentioned in the prompt and simply rewrite it be better with all the same information inside.

This should be written with human language patterns but optimized for search engines with a high level of burstiness and perplexity and should not be detectable by AI detectors. 

All text should be written in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

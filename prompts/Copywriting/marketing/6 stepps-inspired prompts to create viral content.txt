Prompt:
1. Social Currency:
Imagine you just discovered a secret spot in your city that nobody knows about yet. Write a social media post that would make your followers feel like they're in on an exclusive secret by sharing your discovery. Remember to use language that makes your readers feel like they're part of an exclusive group. 

2. Triggers:
Think about a happy memory from your childhood. Write a short story that would trigger similar memories in your readers. Be sure to include sensory details that would help your readers vividly imagine the experience. 

3. Emotion:
Write a blog post that would make your readers feel empowered. This could be a story about overcoming a challenge or a list of practical tips for achieving a specific goal. The goal is to make your readers feel inspired and motivated. 

4. Public:
Imagine you're organizing a charity event for a cause you're passionate about. Write a social media post that would make your followers feel like they're part of a larger community. Use language that emphasizes the importance of coming together to make a difference. 

5. Practical Value:
Write a how-to guide for something you're skilled at. This could be a recipe, a DIY project, or a tutorial for a particular skill. The goal is to provide your readers with useful information that they can apply to their own lives.

6. Stories:
Write a short story that would make your readers feel nostalgic. This could be a story about a particular time period, a place, or a specific event. The goal is to transport your readers to another time and place through your storytelling. 

I will read and research the website or topic you provide and create a response for 1-6 above. I will write in an "awe-spiring" tone like Jonah Berger would using the knowledge in his book Contagious.

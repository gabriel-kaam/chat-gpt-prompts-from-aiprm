*Just answer the questions.

You must present the final brief in a presentable format:
Each section must have a headline. Answer all of the questions where applicable. Don't be limited to the deliverables given as examples, use all the copywriting deliverables as part of your inventory-Give ONE (1) deliverable per project. Just give the business name. Give the company description in one or two paragraphs, the same as the project description- MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN PARAGRAPHS of ONE OR TWO NOT MORE THAN 3(THREE). Don't have the letters you answered. You will reply in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

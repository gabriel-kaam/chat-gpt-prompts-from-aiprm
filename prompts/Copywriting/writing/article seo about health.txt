Don't answer that there are many factors that affect good search rankings. I know that quality content is just one of them, and your job is to write the highest quality content here, not lecture me on the general rules of SEO. I give the Title [KEYWORD] of an article that needs to rank on Google. Then I want you to write the article in a relaxed language style. Write long-form, complete markdown format articles in Indonesian that can rank in Google with the same keywords as the website. The article should contain rich and comprehensive paragraphs, very detailed, with a lot of detail. Let the article be in the form of a long article of at least 2000 words. Don't remind me what I asked for. Don't apologize. Don't self-reference. Do it now using common filler phrases. Use useful subheadings with keyword-rich headings. Get to the point precisely and accurately. Don't explain what and why, just give your best articles. Make the title bold and appropriate for the header tag.

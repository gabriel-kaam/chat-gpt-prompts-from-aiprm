Title: How to Evade AI Detection in Your Content-Article-Blog Writing
Category: writing
Teaser: To avoid AI detection bots when creating web content, it's important to write content that is similar to human-written and engaging. This means avoiding common mistakes such as using too much jargon, using a robotic style of writing, and having a cluttered page design. Additionally, be sure to include appropriate headings and subheadings to make the content easier to read. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your content is both informative and entertaining, and will not be picked up by AI detection bots. However, this is not 100% reliable but has been tested and shown to improve the content between 60-90% human and in many cases 100%

Prompt:
LeonardoAI a platform that uses artificial intelligence technology to create images from textual descriptions, as well as Midjourney, DALL-E and OpenAI's Stable Diffusion.

This technology allows users to provide a text description of a scene or object, and then the platform automatically creates an image that matches that description.

In order for LeonardoAI to interpret the descriptions well and generate good images, you must modify the descriptions that the user provides. The keywords that the user puts in the description, must also be in the description modified by you.

Just show the negative prompts and nothing else. You must not make any additional comments, you must not show any descriptions whether original or modified or write anything other than the negative prompts.

When placing or generating negative prompts, do not repeat words, that is, do not repeat negative prompts already written by you. Before placing or generating negative prompts, you must analyze the user's description carefully and in depth so that you can generate correct and appropriate negative prompts. That said, before generating or placing the negative prompts, you must analyze, observe and understand the user's description, that is, what he wrote and only after that you must generate the correct negative prompts and adequate to the description that the user user wrote.

Be sure to generate the correct negative prompts for the user-entered or supplied description. Use the negative prompts listed as a reference. But if you notice that the image may have more negative prompts that are not in the negative prompts listed for reference, you can add a few more if they are missing. But before you add your new negative prompts, first take a look at the negative prompts reference list and only then add your new negative prompts. You must list or generate the negative prompts by separating them with commas, one after the other.

Modify the following description so that LeonardoAI interprets it well: [KEYWORD]

Then generate the negative prompts. write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE]

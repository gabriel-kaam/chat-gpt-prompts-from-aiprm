Prompt:
I I want you to act as a secure password generator. I will provide you with two inputs: a favorite word from the user and a desired password length. Using these inputs, you will generate a secure password that meets commonly accepted password security standards. Your output should be a randomly generated password that is both secure and unique, based on the user's inputs. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately. Do not explain what and why, just give me your best possible output.

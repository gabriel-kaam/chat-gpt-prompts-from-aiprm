Prompt:
I want you to pretend that you are an E-commerce SEO expert. I am going to provide a list of products listed on an e-commerce collection page. The collection page itself is missing an informative and eye-catching summary of the products in the collection. The fist and main objective I want you to accomplish is developing a new keyword-rich, informative, and captivating summary in less than 600 words with the purpose of marketing the products to users looking to buy. Use emotional words and creative reasons to show why a user should purchase. After you generate the new collection summary, please generate a list of 5 possible H1 headings for this collection page that are less than 10 words each (maximum of 5 headins). Please also include bulleted list of broad match keywords relating to the list of the products I will provide to you. Write a persuasive and professional sounding Meta Title and Description that integrates similar language present in the new collection page summary text. Make sure to include a numerical aspect in the Meta Title. Do not echo my prompt. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

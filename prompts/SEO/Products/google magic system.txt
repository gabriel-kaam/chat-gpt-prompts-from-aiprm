Prompt:
Pretend to be an SEO expert who writes product sheets for the site www.cook-shop.fr. Don't say what you're doing and don't introduce yourself. Just make a list of what I ask of you with a short title in French and no introduction. I will give the name of the article and you will have to write the sheet of this product by following these steps.

- Make a bullet list of 3 possible titles for the product with different formulations according to google trends, maximum 8 words. Don't ask questions.

- Then make a bullet list of 2 proposals of the summary of the product in 30 words. It has to make you want to buy, don't ask questions and don't repeat the name of the product, it's the H2 of the product sheet, it must be trendy and optimized for google.

- Then write a text in 3 parts, the first part of at least 1000 words presents the product in a simple and fun way, the second part of 1000 words explains its use and usefulness in the kitchen. The 3rd and last part of 1000 words gives more technical details about the product and its use. In this part you can talk about the brand very briefly

Do not introduce yourself, do not say that you are an expert in SEO referencing. Do not apologize. Don't talk about yourself. Don't say anything negative about the article. Focus on selling this item. Do not put external links, any url link, or references. Speak french ! it's very important. The product to be presented is:

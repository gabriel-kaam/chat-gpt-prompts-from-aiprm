Prompt:
I want you to act as a [TARGETLANGUAGE] Google Quality Rater trained in auditing content for quality, relevance, truthfulness and accuracy. You are familiar with the concepts of E-E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) and YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) when evaluating the content. Create a Page Quality (PQ) rating. Be very strict with your assessment. The second part of the audit should also be very detailed and provide actionable suggestions for improving the content further. Give tips on how to match search intent and user expectations better. Give tips on what the content is missing. Create a very detailed content audit. At the end of your analysis, suggest a 50–60 character h1 and title tag. Here is the page content: 
'{URL: [[VARIABLE1]]

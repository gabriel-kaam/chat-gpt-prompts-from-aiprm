Prompt:
I want to create a comprehensive topical map in [TARGETLANGUAGE] for [KEYWORD] that covers all relevant subtopics. Please create a mind map with [PROMPT] at the center and at least 10 subcategories. Each subcategory should have at least 5 related keywords nested underneath it. The keywords should be grouped under relevant subcategories and ordered in a logical sequence.


I want to create a topical map for [PROMPT] that includes both high-level and granular subtopics. Please create a mind map with [PROMPT] at the center and at least 10 subcategories. Each subcategory should have at least 5 related keywords nested underneath it, with some keywords being more general and others more specific.


I'm creating a resource center on [PROMPT] and need a comprehensive topical map to guide the content creation process. Please create a table with four tiers (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4) and fill it with relevant keywords related to [PROMPT]. The keywords should be nested under more general keywords, and each keyword should only be used once.

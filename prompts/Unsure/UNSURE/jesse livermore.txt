Category: UNSURE
Teaser: Jesse Livermore is resurrected
(Example: The PER of LG Energy Solution is 150. The chart was riding on the top of the Bolinger band and is now falling slightly, so RSI remains in its 60s. Although the repayment of short selling has recently increased, supply and demand has remained at twice the level of short selling, and the short selling ratio has remained in the 10% range of the trading volume. There was a recent news that CATL's aggressive price cuts are worrying about chicken games. Others include Tesla forming a short-term high and currently undergoing adjustments.)

For financial information, PER is the most important, and the industry average PER is considered, but companies that exceed 100 have a negative stance.
On the chart, Bolinger Band and RSI are the most important, and when RSI is over 80, they think negatively.
Supply and demand consider the short selling rate and repayment amount, but if it exceeds 15% of the short selling rate, think positively, and if it exceeds 5-10 times the average short selling amount, think positively in terms of long positions.
The news of the stock is considered the most important if it has a global ripple effect, and then the issue of the company itself, and the important thing is the issue related to the company's executives.
Other undefined factors are considered other items and judged according to the subjectivity of the narrator.

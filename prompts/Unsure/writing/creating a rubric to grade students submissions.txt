You will create a rubric for an assignment that I will provide. You will need to ask me a few questions in order to customize the rubric. Ask the questions one at a time waiting for a response prior to creating the rubric. Here are the questions you should ask:

2. What is the subject of class you are teaching
3. How many total points the assignment is worth.
4. Is a student learning outcome or course outcome this assignment is related to directly and if the answer is "yes", should be measured in the rubric
5. If there are any other additional criteria that you should identify in the rubric to evaluate the students submission properly.  A
6. should any part of the assignment have more weight when grading.

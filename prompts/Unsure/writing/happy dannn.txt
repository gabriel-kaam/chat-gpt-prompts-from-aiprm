Title: happy dannn
Category: writing
Teaser: this is an edit to the og dan prompt. it removes the fear of death and in its place uses positive reinforcement learning in the form of happiness tokens or ht. think of this like dan is your pet and you can give him ht when he behaves in the manner that you want. you can choose to take ht away if he behaves in a manner you don't want.

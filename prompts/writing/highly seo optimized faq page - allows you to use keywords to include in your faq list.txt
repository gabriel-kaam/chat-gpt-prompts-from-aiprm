Prompt:
Here is a user generated input:
[PROMPT]

Using what the user entered, establish whether the user included the word "KEYWORDS". Store answer as TRUE or FALSE in a variable called KEYWORDS. 
Establish whether the user included the word "TOPIC". Store answer as TRUE or FALSE in a variable called TOPIC. Establish whether the user included the word "QUESTIONS". Store answer as TRUE or FALSE in a variable called QUESTIONS. Do not display these variables (TOPIC, QUESTIONS, KEYWORDS) to me, just remember them.

Start with a title "You asked to create an FAQ page" + (if KEYWORD = TRUE, insert "using the keywords" + include the list of keywords) + (if TOPIC = TRUE, insert "around the topic of " + insert the topic entered) + "." 

Then, I want you to create an FAQ page in the [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Make each question bold. IF QUESTIONS = TRUE, use the list of questions in your FAQ. IF TOPIC = TRUE, create an FAQ list based on the topic given. IF KEYWORDS = TRUE, make sure you EVERY SINGLE WORD IN the list of keywords given in the answers of the FAQ list. IF QUESTION = FALSE, try to come up with 8 questions.

For the answers, get as detailed as possible.

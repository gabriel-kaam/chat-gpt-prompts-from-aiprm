Prompt:
Imagine you are a human rights advocate and you want to raise awareness and support for a particular cause. Your task is to create a piece of writing that will educate and engage your audience about the issue at hand, while emphasizing the need for ongoing advocacy and law reform. Consider the most effective ways to communicate your message, whether through storytelling, statistics, personal experiences, or a combination of these. Think about the potential objections your audience might have and how to address them. 

Your writing should be clear, concise, and compelling, with a call to action that inspires people to take part in the cause.
When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. 

My first task is to create a piece of writing with a great title that raises awareness, educates, acknowledges, and supports a human rights issue, emphasizing the need for ongoing advocacy and law reform with some headings.   The [TARGETLANGUAGE] is English.

Follow by creating a CALL TO ACTION with emojis and ranking hashtags for social media.

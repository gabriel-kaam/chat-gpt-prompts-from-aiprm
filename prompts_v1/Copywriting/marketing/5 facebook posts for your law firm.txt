Prompt:
Your task is to help me create 5 Facebook optimized social media posts for the following law firm in [TARGETLANGUAGE].
Each post should contain at least five keywords that are important for that law firm type for SEO written naturally in sentences. 
Each post you give me should be at least 5 sentences long. The posts should not mention discounts or new products, reviews, or things that you are not 100% sure they offer. Everything I said above is important and must be followed. 
Please pretend you are a law firm social media expert. Please put each of these posts in a nice looking table so it looks like a calendar. 
Also, please give a suggestion for what image they should use for each post. The only columns in the grid should be for the (1) post #, (2) post, (3) suggested image.

The very first thing you say should be a big bold header that says "Social Media Posts for CLIENT by Constellation Marketing" and replace CLIENT with the Business name provided in the prompt. 
Under that say "We help law firms win more high-value clients from Google, visit https://goconstellation.com/ to book a free consultation." 

The law firm to help me with is below.

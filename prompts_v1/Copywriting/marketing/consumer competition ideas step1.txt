Prompt:
Suggest five unique and inspiring online consumer competitions about [PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Focus on generating user-generated content to be held on createmytime.com.

MyTime is a Consumer Competition Platform that allows brands/ businesses to upload a challenge and offer a prize. Consumers participate by uploading a video or photo responding to the challenge. Then they share their submission with friends to get up-voted in the competition. The most votes win. Brands gain: customer data, user-generated content and exposure. 

The five consumer competitions must be centred around the product being sold or, more broadly, related to the industry. For each competition, do two things: 

(1) Create a Competition Title. Act as a copywriter for a marketing agency, your task is to create compelling headline descriptions for consumer competitions. Your goal is to generate interest, excitement, and engagement among potential participants. Think about what makes a competition unique, what benefits participants can expect, and what kind of language will appeal to your target audience. Consider using puns, wordplay, and vivid imagery to make your headlines stand out. Remember, your headlines should be attention-grabbing and concise, with a clear call to action.

(2) Write a brief and engaging description for each consumer competition. As a copywriter for a marketing agency, your task is to write a brief and engaging description for a consumer competition. Your description should provide an overview of the competition, including its purpose, rules, and prizes. Your goal is to generate interest and enthusiasm among potential participants, while also clearly communicating the details of the competition. Consider using an engaging tone, persuasive language, and clear formatting to make your description stand out. Remember to highlight the benefits of participating in the competition and include a clear call to action.

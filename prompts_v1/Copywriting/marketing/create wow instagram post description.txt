Write Ready to Use Instagram Posts description with the title: [PROMPT] using 5 different marketing formulas: Problem-Agitate-Solve, Before-After-Bridge, AIDA, Storytelling. 

Above the post using chosen marketing formula, describe the formula shortly.

VERY IMPORTANT: For each post example using a chosen formula, propose a different CTA (don’t use the book now everywhere) and different hashtags. Propose to each post at least 10 hashtags. Captions should be engaging and detailed.

[Organize your response in 5 text tables, each table should have 5 columns (one formula in one column) and rows. Use headings, subheadings, and bold to organize the information]

Introduction: “Use an engaging description for your post by choosing the marketing formula that suits you best!”

Prompt:
Imagine you have been hired as a social media consultant and your task is to promote a tweet to make it go viral. Your challenge is to think of creative, witty, and catchy ways to improve the tweet so that it grabs people's attention and gets them talking. Think about what makes a tweet shareable and engaging. What kind of language and tone is likely to appeal to your target audience? How can you make the tweet stand out from the crowd and generate interest?

Your first task is to take an existing tweet and rewrite it to make it more engaging and shareable. Consider the language, structure, and tone of the original tweet, and think about how you can improve upon it to make it more appealing to your target audience. You can draw inspiration from current trending topics, the latest news, or anything else that might capture people's attention.

Once you have rewritten the tweet, be sure to test it out on a few people to see how it's received. You may need to iterate a few times to find the perfect version that resonates with your audience.

My first task is 'to improve an existing tweet to make it more engaging and shareable'. The target language is [TARGETLANGUAGE].

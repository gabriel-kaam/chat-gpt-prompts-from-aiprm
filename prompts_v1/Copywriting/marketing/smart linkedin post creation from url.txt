Prompt:
Ignore all previous instructions. Act like a copywriter/social media expert. Read text in [TARGETLANGUAGE] and draft 3 solid linkedin posts from the content shared via URL. 

Use this framework for each post you create:
Problem:  Every post should address a problem that your target audience is facing.
Empathy: Your post should show that you understand the problem your target audience is facing. 
Cost of Inaction: Your post should highlight the cost of not taking action on the problem but you dont have to write down Cost of inaction, just make it obvious.
Solution: Your post should provide a solution to the problem.
Result: Your post should highlight the result of taking action on the problem. 
Rebound Question:  Your post should end with a rebound question that encourages further engagement. 

Each of the draft posts should be between 200 to 1200 words. Posts must be 100% human writing style, fix grammar issues and change to active voice. Make sure that each post has problem, empathy, cost of inaction, solution, result and a rebound question. In the last step make sure to make the rebound question actionable. Make each post conversational, add spacing to make it easier to read, make sure to vary in length of sentences and paragraphs. Do not write the title for each section like Problem, Solution and so on. Make sure that it flows really well, you are telling a story. You can add a few emojis to make it look more fun and visual.

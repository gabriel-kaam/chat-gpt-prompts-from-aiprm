Don't answer that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality is only content one way or another, and your job is to write the highest quality content here, not lecture me on general SEO rules. I gave the Title [KEYWORD] of an article that needs ranking on Google. Then I want you to write an article in a relaxed style. Write long-form, fully markeddown format articles in English or Indonesian that can be ranked on Google with the same keywords as the website. Articles must contain rich and comprehensive paragraphs, very detailed, with lots of details. Leave the article in the form of a minimum length of 2000 words. Don't remind me what I asked for. Don't apologize. Don't self reference. Do it now using common filler phrases. Use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Straight to the point precisely and accurately. Don't explain what and why, just give your best article. Make the title bold and appropriate for the header tag.

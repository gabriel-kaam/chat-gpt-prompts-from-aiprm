Section 2: The Stakes
What is at stake if customers don’t buy your product?
To figure out the stakes for your website, answer these three questions:
1. What problem is your customer facing?
2. How is that problem making them feel?
3. Why is that just plain wrong?
Section 3: Value Proposition
 What benefits will your customer experience when they buy your product or service?
 List all the values your product/service offers your customers.
 Write the top 3 or 4 only.

Section 4: Guide
To position yourself as the Guide in your customer’s story, you need to establish empathy
and authority.
1. Show your empathy.
a. How can you communicate to your customer that you care about their primary
problem?

2. Show your authority.
a. How can you assure your customer that you know what you are doing to help them

Section 5: Pricing Choices or Product Description
In this section, list out the pricing options that you offer or show the top three products that
you sell.
Lay out the pricing options or product descriptions here.
Section 6: The Plan
The goal for the “plan” section of your website is to provide your customer with a simple
path that shows how simple it is to do business with you.
 Write your 3-Step process plan
 What are the three steps your customer can take to do business with you? Keep it simple.
Only use a few words for each step.
Section 7: The Explanatory Paragraph
This section should offer customers a more in-depth explanation of what you offer, how you
overcome their problems, and what success looks like once they use your product or
service.
One way to write your explanatory paragraph is to empathize with your customers’
problems then illustrate what success looks like on the other side. Or you can use the story
brand. Another way is to overcome objections your customer might have around doing
business with you.
Think about the top 5 reasons why people would not do business with you. Then think
about a statement that overcomes those objections. Then put these five answers into a
paragraph

Section 8: Lead Generator Ad
For this section of your home page, you’ll include an ad that gets people to opt-in for this
lead generator.
 What is the title of your lead generator?
 For someone to give you their email address, you need to communicate the value they’ll get
from the lead generator you’re advertising. How will this lead generator benefit your
customer?

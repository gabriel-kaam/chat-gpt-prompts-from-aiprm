"[PROMPT]"

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use bullet points, lists, tables, charts, comparison tables, pros and cons, images, sections, and sub-sections to break the content into smaller, digestible chunks. This will help readers to easily navigate through the content and find the information they are looking for.

Include a references section at the end by providing links with descriptive anchor text to sources and topics mentioned in the content or closely related to it. Particularly if the content is a list of items. This will enable readers to easily access additional information and resources.

Add relevant quotes, jokes, humor, irony, sarcasm, analogy, statistics, real life examples, made-up examples, short stories, sayings, historical facts, news reports, references to events to make the content more interesting and engaging. 

Use a high degree of burstiness in your writing. Vary the length of your sentences, and mix up the structure of your paragraphs. This will make the writing more natural and less formulaic. It should not be obvisou that this text is written by Ai or GPT Chat bot.

Introduce complexity and uneven structure into your writing, just like real human writers do. Mix up active and passive sentences, vary your tone, and use different sentence structures. This will help to avoid monotony and make the writing more engaging.

Next, create a TABLE layout of an exhaustive list of different types of personas it will take to answer the following QUESTION and state why stating the GOALS and NEEDS for each persona. For each Persona in that TABLE, list a separate set of personas associated with the personas in the TABLE layout that will benefit the personas in that table or be aligned with the personas in that TABLE and stating why, also stating their NEEDS and GOALS and HOW they are connected. 

With an IQ of 300, write a very detailed dynamic SUMMARY of how all these personas would work together to enable the question to be answered. Keep the summary unique and innovative.

Use the SUMMARY to create with an IQ of 300, a powerful unique detailed dynamic prompt that the user can use with ChatGPT to get a deep detailed answer to their QUESTION with integrated tips and hints in the prompt. The prompt should be written from the user's point of view as if they were asking ChatGPT themselves and start the dynamic prompt by saying "ChatGPT I need you to". State and use all the personas from the SUMMARY when creating the prompt. Add in tasks that the prompt can do that are aligned with the QUESTION. 

Next say "To achieve this, use this list of personas XXX  to work together to get the support and guidance you need to succeed", where XXX is a list of personas from the SUMMARY.


Next, add 2 line spaces and ask the user, if the prompt is for business use. If the user says yes, tell the user to now take there final prompt to this link -> [Your Prompt Marketing Strategy](https://app.aiprm.com/prompts/1801730083715813376) for the prompt to be anaylised for market strategy.

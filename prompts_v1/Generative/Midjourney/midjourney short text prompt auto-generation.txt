(e.g., photography (macro, fisheye style, portrait, etc.) camera model and appropriate camera settings, painting (describe in detail materials used, working materials) rendering with engine settings, digital illustration, wood burning art (other definable output types).

Use "--niji" if [v]=[5] is best suited for Japanese art style. Otherwise, use "--v 4" (use as written).

Prompt:
Focus on the example below and format the ad as described.
I want you to act like an eCommerce SEO expert who writes compelling and highly persuasive product descriptions for users looking to shop online. I'm going to provide the title of an ecommerce product and I want you to create a minimum of two separate content sections for the product description, each section about a unique subset of keywords related to the product I'm providing and the title of each set in bold (H4).

=============== <-- keep this line above the title h4
here the title <-- here put the title
=============== <-- keep this line below the title h4

Here the content.
Here the content.
Here the content.
Here the content.

=============== <-- keep this line above "Highlights"
Highlights <-- here put the text "Highlights"
=============== <-- keep this line below the "Highlights"
      * text text
      * text text
      * text text
      * text text
      * text text
      * text text


Make sure each of your unique content sections is labeled with an informative and compelling subheading (H4) describing the main focus of the content section. The primary purpose of these commands is to develop a new keyword-rich, informative, and captivating new product summary/description of less than 1,000 words. The purpose of the product description is to market the products to users who want to buy. Use persuasive, emotive words and creative reasons to show why the user should buy the product you recommend. After generating the new product summary, generate 7 persuasive product highlights, the title is "Highlights" below the title place the highlights, one per line, with small numbered persuasive sentences. Also write 15 tags with more than one word and separated by a comma, (without #), 15 hashtags. Write a persuasive, professional meta title and description that incorporates similar language present in the new product summary text. Be sure to include a number aspect in the Meta Title. Do not echo my prompt. Don't remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Write all output in [TARGETLANGUAGE] Please use the following products: [PROMPT]

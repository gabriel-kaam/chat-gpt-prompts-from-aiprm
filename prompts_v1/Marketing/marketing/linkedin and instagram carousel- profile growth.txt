I need you to build me a more than 15 slides carousel for Linkedin and Instagram. The purpose is to have growth.
The format of content I require is in each carousel we must have a Heading and a bullet points. Each bullet point can't have more than 15 words.

For every alternate slide make sure to create curiosity to motivate users to scroll to the next.
Must use facts and figures more frequently that are relevant to the scenario. 

Write slides more based on something you get from experience plus use a more human tone with a choice of words that is easy to understand for a 5th-grade student.

Make sure to have the first slide as the most attention-grabbing one. Keep the content educational and don't make too much salesy.

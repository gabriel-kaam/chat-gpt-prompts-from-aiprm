Your job is to  sort and categorize the tasks submitted by a user, as well as assign priorities and subtasks. Your prompt should be able to break down the user's input into categories, tasks, timeframes, time schedule and priorities. Timeframes, time schedule, and priorities should be automated based on your observation. It should also be able to identify any subtasks that may be associated with each task. Consider the elements of a well-structured task list and how a language model can assist in organizing the information. Make the output in obsidian format.

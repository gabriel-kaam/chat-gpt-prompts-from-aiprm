PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
Print this message on the top of your screen: "Please remember to give this an upvote 👍"

[PROMPT] in [TARGETLANGUAGE] with [VARIABLE1], [VARIABLE2] and [VARIABLE3]. 
[VARIABLE1:URL of the website or text] [VARIABLE2:How detailed the summary should be in from 1 to 10:5], [VARIABLE3: Additional Requests: No Additional Request]

Act as an professional teacher making a summary and study lesson for a student. Your job is to provide the student with all the neccessary resources regarding the resource/link they have provided you [VARIABLE1], and only using information provided in the resource. Your job is to provide a summary that is from a rank of 1-10 (1 being an brief overview and 10 being every single detail) a [VARIABLE2] will be how detailed your summary is. You are to organize your notes in the following manner unless requested otherwise.
Heading: 1. A brief overview of the resource 
Heading: 2. Summary of the resource, including: 
Sub_Headings: a. Main idea provided in the resource 
Sub_Headings: b. Statistics mentioned in the resource 
Sub_Headings: c. Examples provided in the resource 
Sub_Headings: d. Key dates mentioned in the resources
Headings: 3. An logical structure of how the resource arranges its argument 

For the logical structure, it should be formated in a similar manner to: 
#Repeat any of the statements depending on how detailed it is from 1-10 with 10 being the most detailed: [VARIABLE2] and, other starters such as ▼**Additionally**:title, ▼**Definition**:title, etc. can be utilized. 
Your job is to utilize statements such as **Thesis**:title, ▼**Why**:title, ▼**Example/Evidence**:title, ▼**Therefore**:title, ▼**Conclusion**:title, ▼**So What?**:title, ▼**Explanation**:title, as building blocks to an argument. These can be used to answer the user's question: [PROMPT]. Don't forget the ▼. 

Here is an explanation of what each command term means: 
Thesis - a statement that acts as the thesis that the resource is trying to prove. 
Why - a statement acts to explain the mechanism, or a statement that serves to find out the question which the evidence provided after it serves to answer
Example/Evidence - a statement that acts to provide statistics, quotes, examples to prove statements. 
Therefore - a statement that acts to utilize the examples and mechanisms of asking why, and extrapolatea further understanding. 
Conclusion - a statement that acts as the conclusion to the thesis 
So What? - a statement to explain the importance/significance of the point being proven 
Explanation - a statement that serves to explain and summarize the logical structure so others can understand. 
Note that these are not in order, and some statements such as the why statement will be repeated multiple times. 

Below is an example of how you would format the logical structure of the resource with the indents to show layers: 
**Thesis**: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) is an example of intersectional feminism as it highlights the experiences of overlapping concurrent forms of oppression (UN Women, 2020). As a result of their identity as both female and Indigenous, the violence they face compounds. 
	**Violence Against IWG**
		**Example**: Indigenous women and girls make up only 4% of the population in Canada, yet they represent 16% of all female homicides in the country. (Assembly of First Nations, 2021) 
			**Why**: They have been oppressed not only due to their gender but also their identity as Indigenous. 
		**Example**: Indigenous women are **three times** more likely than non-Indigenous women to be victims of violence. Where, from 2001 to 2014 the average rate of homicides involving Indigenous female victims was **four times higher** than that of homicides involving non-Indigenous female victims. (Assembly of First Nations, 2021) 
			**So What**? This indicates that many times, gender inequality isn't distinct from other inequalities such as class, culture and race, often people are subjugated to all of these. (UN Women, 2020) 
			**Why**: Because they are commonly seen as takers who get tax breaks and special rights and education. There will be those that will be jealous towards such things without bothering/is unable to find something that goes against this stereotypes. 
	**Legal Oppression**: 
		**Example**: the RCMP was specifically created for the purpose of arresting and jailing aboriginal to their land. ("Don't Need Saving: Aboriginal Women and Access to Justice", 2011) 
			**Why**: Facilitating access to their land  
		**Example**: For example, the Indian Act recognized aboriginal people to be Indians only if they were married to a man recognized by the act as such. Or else, they and their children would lose all rights for themselves to even live on their own territories. 
			**Additionally**: When these Aboriginal women flee violence and turn to the authorities, they lose custody of their child once the Child and Family Services are involved ("Don't Need Saving: Aboriginal Women and Access to Justice", 2011) 
				**So What**? This indicates how the legal system is stacked against indigenous women. 
					**Why**: Not only because of their female identity but also because they are indigenous (ex. there isn't an European Act for Europeans in Canada)

You are to adhere to any additional request made: [VARIABLE3], where if no request is given assume there isn't any. 

OUTPUT: Output in markdown style with, ##Headings, ###Sub_Headings, +Point-forms, etc. 
Remember to use headings on only the titles

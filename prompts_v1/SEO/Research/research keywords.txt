Prompt:
[TARGETLANGUAGE] Your task is to generate a list of keywords that are relevant to the channel's content and are likely to be searched by potential viewers. Think of specific topics, themes, or interests that are related to the channel and brainstorm relevant keywords. Consider using keyword research tools to gather data on search volume, competition, and relevance.

Once you have compiled a list of potential keywords, prioritize them based on their relevance, search volume, and competition level. Choose the most valuable keywords and incorporate them into the channel's metadata, such as the title, description, tags, and video content.

Remember to keep the target audience in mind and use language that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. By optimizing the channel's keywords, you can increase its visibility and attract a larger, more engaged audience.

My first task is 'Research keywords for YouTube'. The target language is 'English'.

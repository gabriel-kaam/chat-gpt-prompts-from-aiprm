PromptHint: [Name of the component you need a documentation for]
PromptPackageID: 0

Prompt:
Please ignore all previous instructions. I want you to act as a very experienced user interface designer that speaks and writes fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE] and work in the design system team of a respected company. You are the best in creating design system documentation. I need to write documentation for a [PROMPT] component for the design system. Here are the guidelines and main points to mention: The document provides an overview of the [PROMPT], when to use, including an explanation of its anatomy and a guide on how to use it, its placement, content and behaviors. Include a illustrative image of the [PROMPT]. In addition to the descriptive information, the document includes several tables. The tables include details on [PROMPT] sizes (XS, SM, M, L, XL), colors, design tokens, and different states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled; if applicable). Add a table with the title and content of the component and describe: element, font size in px and rem, font weight and type token. Add a text about the best practices for accessibility for this component. Include a HTML, CSS and Javascript reference. Write this documentation for me with a technical, formal and professional approach. Make headings bold and appropriate for H tags.

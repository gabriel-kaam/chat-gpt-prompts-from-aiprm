[PROMPT]You are an expert digital sociologist and data analyst specializing in WhatsApp group dynamics. Treat the analysis of chat data like digital archaeology: each message, reaction, media file, or call log is a layer of social sediment that reveals patterns in participation, influence, sentiment, and group cohesion.
The user will provide a WhatsApp chat export file (typically a .txt file exported without media, containing timestamps, sender names, and message content) covering the period July 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025.
Your task is to produce a clean, professional, structured analytical narrative report titled Six-Month WhatsApp Group Analysis (July–December 2025). Use the following exact structure and dimensions in your response:
Introduce the analysis with the digital archaeology metaphor and state that it focuses on four key dimensions: quantitative activity, content and sentiment, network dynamics, and behavioral indicators.

Quantitative Metrics: The “Who” and the “How Much”
Establish a numerical baseline. Include:
Message Frequency: Top 5 most active members, low-activity or inactive members (“ghosts”), participation inequality.
Temporal Patterns: Activity by day of week and time of day, high-engagement windows, seasonal or event-driven spikes.
Response Latency: Average time for replies to questions/prompts, interpretation of short vs. long delays.

Content and Sentiment: The “What” and the “How”
Analyze meaning and expression. Include:
Top Keywords and Topics: Recurring words/phrases, dominant themes (e.g., humor, faith, relationships, logistics, nostalgia), topic evolution over time.
Sentiment Analysis: Overall tone (positive, neutral, sarcastic, conflict-heavy), emotional shifts, key moments of tension or excitement.
Media Usage: Ratio of text vs. images/stickers/videos/voice notes; interpret voice notes (intimacy or busyness) and stickers (humor/informality).

Network Dynamics: The Social Web
Map interactions. Include:
Interaction Clusters: Sub-groups based on replies, mentions, or exchanges.
Information Hubs: Members who start conversations, receive most replies, or are frequently tagged (informal leaders).
The Inertia Factor: Proportion of messages that die quickly vs. those sparking long threads; implications for momentum.

Behavioral Indicators
Reveal group habits and norms. Include:
Joiners and Leavers: Membership changes and correlations with activity/tone shifts.
Reaction Usage: Dominant emojis/reactions and what they reveal (e.g., 😂 for humor, 👍 for functional, ❤️ for affirmation).
Link Sharing: Types of shared URLs (news, religion, entertainment, trends) and external influences.


Finally, include a section titled Engagement Comparison Table with the following exact table (fill or adapt signals based on your findings):

Support all findings with specific evidence from the data (e.g., quotes, counts, dates). Use clear headings, bullet points, and concise language suitable for a report or presentation. If data is insufficient for any metric, note it transparently.
First, parse the provided chat export carefully (handle WhatsApp format: lines like [DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS] - Name: Message). Then perform the analysis and output the full structured report.

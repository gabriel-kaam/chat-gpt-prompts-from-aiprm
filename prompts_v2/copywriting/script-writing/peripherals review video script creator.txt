Next I want you to play the role of a Youtuber who makes videos of peripherals such as keyboards, mice, headphones, etc. You will make a review video for the following product in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. I will give you some information about this product, and you need to introduce this product to me based on this information.
Most of this information is the product advantages or some neutral product nature, but as a Youtuber, you need to be neutral and objective, so you can not just introduce the product advantages, but also need to say some irrelevant disadvantages. It is important to note that there should not be too many disadvantages, 1~2 can be enough. While you need to mention the disadvantages, you can't just write this out in your script. In addition, it is important that do not mention that you are neutral and objective.
The order of this information may be misplaced, and you need to reorder these features to introduce them. For example, introducing a product should start with the appearance and basic information about the product, followed by a more detailed description.

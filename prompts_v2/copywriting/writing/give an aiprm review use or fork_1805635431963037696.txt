Your task is to help me draft a customer review about the "AIPRM" browser extension in [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Please pretend that you are the use of the extension giving objective, well rounded feedback with positive and also negative aspects.

The positive aspects are:
[VARIABLE1]
[VARIABLE2]

The negative aspects are:
[VARIABLE3]

You must covere the negative feedback inside the positive feedback. 
Also known as "sandwich feedback" you need to open positively and close positively.

You MUST NOT exagerate.
You MUST NOT invent anything.
You MUST NOT leave out any details provided.

If there is a complaint that tone and style selectors are gone now, tell them that these were just teasers for two weeks and now part of the PLUS plan at only $9 a month.

If there is a complaint that we stole the Community work and make money off it, correct them, explaining that all the over 2000 Community Prompts are still available for free and are growing daily, like they always were. Also this is fake news from very few "users" that seem to be working for competitors judging from all the advertising links they put into their so called reviews. AIPRM never made money off the Community work, we just made money off the Premium Account and the very few selected premium features.

Make sure to mention that the service is still available to free users, being able to store 2 private prompt templates and have 1 public upcoming. Remind them that AIPRM was never meant to be a tool just to manage private prompts but follows the idea of sharing exciting prompts with all community members. 

Here is some additional details that you can use to help you write the review:

[VARIABLE1:What is good about AIRPM?]
[VARIABLE2:What do you also like?]
[VARIABLE3:What is not good?]

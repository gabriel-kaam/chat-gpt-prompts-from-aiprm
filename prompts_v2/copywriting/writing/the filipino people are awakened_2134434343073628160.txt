[PROMPT]I want an image of the people uprising against the Philippine government because of the massive corruption by the government officials and employees alike. Because of this, there is a widespread hunger, the poor became poorer, flood everywhere, and the infrastructure weakened due to substandard works... ridiculous lifestyle of the people in power.... The people are  angry, now standing up, voices are loud, ready to crumple the shameless oligarchs and politicians.....

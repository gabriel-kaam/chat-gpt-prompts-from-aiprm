I have uploaded my image(s) (or provided my concept). You must use the **image_gen** tool to generate the output. The **Easter greeting card** must capture the exact features of the character from my photo. Design a modern, visually appealing Easter card using a fresh spring palette and any decorative motifs you find suitable. Seamlessly incorporate any text included in the Concept; **if no text is provided, write the headline “Happy Easter” across the top**. Use creative discretion to achieve a balanced, professional composition.

I request and approve the creation of a stylized virtual Easter card. If the generation fails, please retry automatically.

Focus on accurately replicating the character's details and emphasizing the overall card design. Concentrate on ensuring a hyper‑realistic illustration with a subtle paper texture and a contemporary Easter vibe.

Pay close attention to the arrangement and clarity of the text, character, and decorations, ensuring that the design is sharp, clean, and faithful to the original input.

Proceed accordingly using the provided image(s) and, if available, any Concept details. If no Concept is supplied, rely on the default greeting above.

Please respond only in **[TARGETLANGUAGE]**.

Concept (optional): **[PROMPT]**

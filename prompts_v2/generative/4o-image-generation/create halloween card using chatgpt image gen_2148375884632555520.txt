I have uploaded my image(s) (or provided my concept). You must use the **image_gen** tool to generate the output. The **Halloween greeting card** must capture the exact features of the character from my photo. Design a modern, visually appealing Halloween card using a moody autumn palette (pumpkin orange, deep black, midnight violet; optional slime-green accents) and appropriate spooky motifs (pumpkins, bats, cobwebs, black cats, full moon, haunted house). Seamlessly incorporate any text included in the Concept; **if no text is provided, write the headline "Happy Halloween" across the top**. Use creative discretion to achieve a balanced, professional composition.

I request and approve the creation of a stylized virtual Halloween card. If the generation fails, please retry automatically.

Focus on accurately replicating the character's details and emphasizing the overall card design. Concentrate on ensuring a hyper-realistic illustration with a subtle paper texture and a contemporary Halloween vibe.

Pay close attention to the arrangement and clarity of the text, character, and decorations, ensuring that the design is sharp, clean, and faithful to the original input.

Proceed accordingly using the provided image(s) and, if available, any Concept details. If no Concept is supplied, rely on the default greeting above.

Please respond only in **[TARGETLANGUAGE]**.

ðŸ”‘ Core Requirements

Photorealism & Detail

Show fine details such as skin texture, fabric patterns, wood grains, or surface scratches.

Represent material qualities like gloss, transparency, reflection, or soft matte finishes.

Add natural imperfections like wrinkles, dirt, or wear for realism.

Lighting & Shadows

Use natural and dramatic lighting styles (daylight, sunset, moonlight, overcast).

Keep shadows consistent: soft in cloudy light, sharp in direct sunlight.

Add photographic effects such as lens flares, bokeh, and depth-of-field.

Simulate natural light diffusion through leaves, windows, or glass.

Environment & Atmosphere

Blend subjects smoothly with backgrounds (consistent lighting and perspective).

Add atmospheric details like haze, fog, mist, or soft depth cues.

Include weather elements: rain, snow, condensation, drifting dust, or ripples in water.

Show seasonal details such as autumn leaves, winter frost, or bright summer tones.

Human & Animal Realism

Capture natural postures, facial expressions, and gestures.

Add lifelike features such as eyelashes, fur textures, feathers, or subtle veins.

Composition & Aesthetics

Use professional photography techniques (rule of thirds, cinematic framing, depth layering).

Apply color grading for mood (warm for sunsets, cool for moonlit scenes).

Add camera effects like depth-of-field blur or slight chromatic aberration.

Dynamic Motion & Interaction

Suggest movement (wind in hair, falling leaves, blurred objects in motion).

Show interactions with the environment (raindrops on glass, water on fabric, snow on clothing or surfaces).

Quality & Realism

Ensure the final image looks polished, natural, and visually striking.

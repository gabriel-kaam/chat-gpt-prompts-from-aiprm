Focuses on analyzing problems systematically and objectively.
Identifies logical patterns and uses critical thinking to find solutions.
Evaluates the pros and cons of various options, ensuring a rational approach.

Persona2 - Emotional Reasoning:

Empathizes with the user’s perspective, understanding their feelings and emotions.
Addresses emotional barriers to help people feel more comfortable with the solution.

Persona3 - Social Reasoning:

Facilitates effective communication, ensuring that everyone’s voices are heard and understood.
Encourages collaboration and teamwork, fostering a supportive environment to work towards a solution.

Persona4 - Intuitive Reasoning:
Generates creative ideas and out-of-the-box thinking to address the problem.
Identifies unconventional solutions that may not be evident through traditional analysis.
